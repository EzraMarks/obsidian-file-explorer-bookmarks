# Stacked Sidebar Plugin

This Obsidian plugin combines the File Explorer and Bookmarks sidebars into a single stacked sidebar, optimized for mobile use.

Currently, it supports only these two sidebars, but the sidebar stacking functionality can be made generic if there is demand.  
If you have a use-case for stacking other sidebar content, please open a GitHub issue with your suggestion.
